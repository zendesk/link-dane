      Link-Dane is Dane County’s first mobile-optimized website that connects homeless and low-income residents with critical and life-saving resources nearby. Focusing on basic services such as food, shelter, medical care, hygiene services, and access to technology, Link-Dane utilizes United Way 2-1-1’s vast database of resources to stream the most up-to-date information to the people who need it most.
    </p><p>
      Zendesk and United Way 2-1-1 began collaborating on the Link-DANE project after being introduced by a colleague at 100 State.  After realizing the potential of the project, the two organizations began brainstorming ways to use 2-1-1 resources to create a product similar to Link-SF. After many design meetings, diving into the data and finalizing the layout, Link-Dane was launched publicly on February 22, 2016.

      Link-Dane is based on <a href="http://www.link-sf.org/">Link-SF</a>, a project designed and implemented by <a href="http://www.stanthonysf.org/">St. Anthony Foundation</a>, Zendesk, and user testing expert <a href="http://kimberlymccollister.com/design/">Kimberly McCollister</a>. This collaboration emerged as a result of a Community Benefits Agreement in the city of San Francisco. St. Anthony’s Tenderloin Technology Lab reached out to the tech community after observing an increase in the use of smart phones by low-income residents. Link-SF is a result of this process and is an attempt to use mobile technology to assist those most in need.
